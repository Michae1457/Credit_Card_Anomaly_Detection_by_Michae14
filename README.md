## Summary
This project develops a machine learning pipeline for detecting anomalies in credit card transactions. It emphasizes feature engineering techniques tailored to improve model accuracy for identifying fraudulent or suspicious activities. Key steps include data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding. The pipeline leverages various transformations and feature selection methods to enhance the data quality, which supports a robust anomaly detection model.

## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains information on purchases made through the purchase card programs administered by the state and higher ed institutions at the Okolahoma state in 2014. The purchase card information will be updated monthly after the end of the month. For example, July information will be added in August. Here is the link to the dataset: https://data.ok.gov/dataset/purchase-card-pcard-fiscal-year-2014.
