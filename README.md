# Credit_Card_Anomaly_Detection_by_Michae14

This project focuses on creating a robust machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. The project primarily deals with feature engineering techniques aimed at improving model performance in detecting potentially fraudulent activities.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applying transformations, selecting important features, and enhancing data for better model training.
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Training a machine learning model specifically designed to detect anomalies in transaction data.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Imputation of missing values, removal of outliers.
- **Feature Scaling**: Ensures numerical stability for model training.
- **Encoding**: Categorical encoding techniques tailored for anomaly detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-anomaly-detection.git
   cd credit-card-anomaly-detection
